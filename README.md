Implementing the model described by Ansari et al in their article An efficient and scalable top-down method for predicting structures of microbial communities, NatCompSci 2021.

### How to
Number of species: Input n
Species abundance in monoculture: Input a vector array (MatLab) or list (Python)
Species abundances in leave-one-out cultures: 2D array where columns specify species and rows specify which leave-one-out setting it is
